Today's task is to Create a Simple Blog Layout using Bootstrap 5.
I created the Simple Blog Layout Page on the topic SALON.
I created an index.html where the 2 pages are refered i.e. hservice.html & contact.html.
Also the navbar.html and footer.html are created separately and linked to all the pages.
The navbar.html contains the links to more options and facilities.
The footer.html contains the social media icons.
I provided the referenced links only to the options of Navbar and not in the Read More button.
Screenshots are provided with all the HTML pages & images.
